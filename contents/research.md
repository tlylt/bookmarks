## Writing up research

### Report Structure
- Abstract
- introduction
- method
- results
- discussion

### Formulating a Research Question

- From a topic, to a guiding question
- address specific aspects of the topic

Example:
- topic: effects of industrial pollution on plant life
  - question: what are the effects of increased concentrations of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere on production of grain sorghum?
  - question: do increased concentrations of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere lead to significant decrease in the production of grain sorghum?

### Formulating a Hypothesis

- statement of expected result
- state in negative way (no effect, will not affect etc), it is called the null hypothesis, which can be rejected

### Introduction
- the setting
- already studied
- investigation needed
- purpose of new study
- optional justification or value of new study

#### The setting
content
- move from general to specific statements
- begin with generally accepted facts about a topic
- identify one subarea within the general area which includes your topic
- arrange ideas in logical sequence
- use old information at the beginning of your sentences

language
- mark generic noun phrases appropriately
  - if countable
    - use plural or
    - omit article or
    - use the indefinite article a or an
    - less obvious
      - if referring to living creatures or familiar machinery and equipment
        - use the definite article the
        - the integration of the computer into the society (meaning "computers in general")
        - the hummingbird can ... ("hummingbirds in general")
  - if uncountable
    - omit article
- mark specific noun phrases appropriately
  - if assumed, shared information
    - use the definite article the
      - in the world...
  - if pointing back to old information already mentioned
    - first time a/an, now the
  - if pointing forward, made clear of the meaning in a following phrase
    - use the
    - **the gas** which is produced in the western state...
- indicate old information 
  - by using repeated or derived words,
  - pronouns
    - this, that
  - place old information in front, and link it to new information
  - example: "plants do photosynthesis", "while this is taking place, ...new information..."

#### Review previous research
purpose
- continue with the background information
- assures readers that you are familiar with the important research
- establishes your study as one link in a chain of research

format
- information prominent
  - information + reference (author, year) or (number - position in the list of references)
- author prominent
  - author + reference (date or reference number) + information

content
- use a logical plan to order your citations
  - grouped by approach
    - one approach
    - another approach
    - etc
  - ordered from distant to close
  - ordered chronologically
- use information prominent and weak author prominent citations at the beginning and at transitional points
- use author prominent citations to report specific findings later in the stage

language
- use verb tenses correctly
  - information prominent citations
    - present tense for facts
      - (topic) + (verb) + fact + reference
      - nutrient resorption is a common phenomenon in forest trees (Karamer, 1979)
  - weak author prominent: several authors
    - present perfect tense
    - authors + verb + topic + references
    - several researchers have studied the relationship between classroom adjustment and mobility (Madsen, 1980; Biggs, 1983; Randall, 1985)
    - topic + verb + authors + references
    - the physiology of annual plants has been studied by several researchers (Madsen, 1980; Biggs, 1983; Randall, 1985)
  - general statements about the level of research activity
    - present perfect tense
    - without citations
    - level + verb + topic
    - Little research has been done on topic development in ESL students' composition
  - author prominent citations: findings from specific studies
    - past tense
    - author + reference + verb of report + that + findings
    - Allington (1983) (found, showed, reported, noted, observed) that teachers allocated equal time to all groups 
  - For author prominent, use the correct form of the verb in the findings, based on your attitude towards the findings
    - accepted as fact
      - use present tense in complement verb
      - author + reference + verb of report + that + findings (present)
      - Sillen (1) showed that aluminum is a good conductor of electricity
    - finding results limited to a single study
      - use past tense in complement verb
      - author + reference + verb of report + that + findings (past)
      - Abramson (1974) reported that mobile students had lower academic performance
      - Harris (7) found that 34.6kg of nitrogen were cycled internally by trees
    - findings that are tentative, suggestions from the authors
      - use modal auxiliaries in the complement, e.g. may, might, could, would
      - author + reference + verb of report(proposed, suggested, hypothesized) + that + findings (modal)
      - Van (5) proposed that aluminium may be common in diatom residues
- use tentative verbs of report for suggestions or proposals
- use modal auxiliaries in the complement to indicate tentative findings
  
  #### Advancing to present research

  Missing information
  - indicate that the previous literature described in the review is inadequate beacause an important aspect of the research area has been ignored by other authors
  - there is an unresolved conflict among the authors of previous studies concerning the research topic. This may be theoretical or methodological disagreement.
  - an examination of the previous literature suggests an extension of the topic, or raise a new research question not previously considered by other workers in your field

  signaling by
  - signal word + Gap (present or present perfect) + research topic
    - (however, but)
    - few studies have been done on
    - little literature is available on
    - very little is known about
    - no work has been done on
